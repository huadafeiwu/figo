//! Internal layout engine — nodes, connectors, geometry, and sizing
//! helpers shared by all diagram modules.
//!
//! The pieces here are deliberately small so each diagram file can stay
//! under the project's 250-line limit. They are NOT part of the public
//! API and live behind the `diagrams` re-exports.
//!
//! - [`geom`]: `Rect`, `Anchor`
//! - [`node`]: `Node`, `NodeBuilder`
//! - [`connector`]: `Connector` and orthogonal routing helpers
//! - [`routing`]: shared routing geometry helpers (`natural_mid_y`, etc.)
//! - [`sizing`]: column distribution, fit-to-width helpers
